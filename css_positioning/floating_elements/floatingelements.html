            It’s been a busy September.
            I had a lot to get done and I’m still working on finishing some things I started in September.
            No matter how busy I am, I continue to find time to read — I never want to stop learning. 
            I’m determined to continue this reading habit to support my decision to keep learning new things.
            It opens my mind!
            New perspectives.
            New ways of doing things.
            I’ve shared some of my top reads for the week before, so I thought I’d share some more.
            Again, I have no affiliation with these writers.
